## eShamba - Empowering African Farmers with AI
Welcome to the eShamba repository. This project aims to bridge the information gap faced by farmers in Africa by developing an AI-powered virtual agronomist platform. The platform leverages AI to provide personalized, data-driven insights and recommendations for sustainable and profitable agricultural practices.

## Structure
* **'backend/': ** This directory contains the server-side code for the platform,including:
* API endpoints for communication with the app.
* Database models for storing user data, crop information, weather data and market data.
* AI model implementations.

* **'app/': **This directory contains code for the application, including:
* User interface components
* Logic for user interactions and data input
* code for communicating with the backend API

* **'models/': **Here, you will find the trained AI models used by eShamba to enhance the platform's capabilities. The models are implemented using Python-based ML/AI libraries.
